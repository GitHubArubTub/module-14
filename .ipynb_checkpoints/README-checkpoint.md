# Machine Learning Trading Bot

Welcome to the Machine Learning Trading Bot project! In this project, we aim to enhance our algorithmic trading strategies using machine learning techniques to adapt to new data and maintain our competitive edge in the market.


### Baseline Algorithm Evaluation

After implementing the baseline trading algorithm with SMA signals and evaluating its performance, we observed that the strategy returns consistently outperformed the actual returns. This initial success suggests the viability of utilizing SMA signals to generate profitable trading decisions. However, the classification report metrics indicated room for improvement in terms of accuracy.

### Alternative Classifier Evaluation

Upon implementing the AdaBoost classifier as an alternative machine learning model, we found that the strategy returns generated by the tuned algorithm did not perform as well as the actual returns. This outcome prompts further investigation and potentially suggests that the AdaBoost model might not be well-suited for our trading strategy or requires additional parameter tuning.

### Final Conclusions

In conclusion, our baseline trading algorithm utilizing SMA signals showcased promising potential, generating strategy returns that consistently surpassed actual returns. However, the accuracy of trading signals remains an area for improvement. The evaluation of the AdaBoost classifier highlighted the complexity of selecting and fine-tuning machine learning models for trading algorithms. It's evident that not all models will yield improved performance.

As we move forward, it's essential to continue experimenting with different algorithms, refining parameters, and exploring alternative features to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our trading strategies.
